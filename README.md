I had the opportunity to work as a freelance web developer for SealTech Pavement Co., a reputable asphalt company based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently developing the sealtechpavement.com web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

- Collaborated closely with the client to ensure their vision and requirements were met.
- Contributed to the final designs of the website, guaranteeing customer satisfaction and a user-friendly experience.
- Implemented a responsive website that effectively showcases the different services offered by SealTech Pavement Co.
- Developing a secure admin panel, empowering the site owners to make dynamic updates and manage website content.

By leveraging my expertise in full-stack web development and utilizing the MERN stack, I am successfully delivering a high-quality web application that is meeting the client's expectations.
